        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>What up! It's me, Juniordoomer! You’re probably wondering why I made this site… I’ll get to that in a sec. But first, let me tell you a little about myself.

I’m a 15-year-old guy, born on November 16, 2009. I’m not gonna share my exact city or state—first off, I'm not allowed to, and second, you’ll have to figure that out for yourself 😏.

I’m 5’10”—so yeah, I’m a tall one 😎. Fair warning: I have trust issues, so trust isn’t automatic; you’ve gotta earn it. And I’ve got a bit of a temper, so don’t fuck with me.

Alright, that’s enough about me. Now, let’s get into why I actually made this website…</p>

        <h2>Why I Made This Site</h2>
        <p>I made this site because... why not, right? Plus I need you guys to download my wads somehow... ya know? So yeap... cya, fellow doomers...</p>
